Android Monkey is a simple shell script to run android monkey tests automatically. 

You can use a Continuous Integration Server like Hudson or just a cron job, whatever you prever.


The script generate a random seed to start the monkey with, this seed will be saved if a crash has happened.
When rerunning the script, this seed will be used and this way the monkey injects the same random events as when the app crashed. 

Feel free to fork the this and contribute back :)
